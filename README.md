# face-mask-detection

face mask detection model is developed using machine learning concepts.
the model is trainined with the datasets and then it is able to detect that the person is wearing mask or not


The requirements to run the code are:
tensorflow
numpy
imutils
keras
opencv-python
scipy
matplotlib

*****to train the model run train.ipynb 
*****to detect the face mask run detect_mask.ipynb


the dataset for the face mask detection is downloded from the github repository
